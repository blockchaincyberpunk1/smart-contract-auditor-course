Static Analysis with Slither

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to the Slither tool, which is used for static analysis of smart contract code. Students will be provided with a set of smart contract source code files and will use Slither to perform static analysis. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities within the code, generate a report documenting the issues found, and propose recommended solutions. This assignment aims to develop students' proficiency in utilizing static analysis tools for smart contract auditing.

Instructions:

Introduction to Slither:

Provide students with an overview of the Slither tool and its significance in smart contract auditing.
Explain the benefits of using static analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities in smart contract code.
Smart Contract Source Code:

Offer students a set of smart contract source code files for analysis.
Ensure that the provided code includes various types of vulnerabilities or issues that Slither can detect (e.g., reentrancy, unchecked sends, integer overflow/underflow).
Static Analysis with Slither:

Instruct students to use the Slither tool to perform static analysis on the provided smart contract code.
Encourage them to explore different Slither commands and options for comprehensive analysis.
Task students with identifying and documenting vulnerabilities or issues detected by Slither.
Vulnerability Report:

Require students to generate a detailed report summarizing the results of their static analysis.
The report should include:
A list of identified vulnerabilities or issues.
Descriptions of each vulnerability, including potential impact and attack scenarios.
References to the specific lines of code where each issue was found.
Recommended solutions or fixes for each vulnerability, if applicable.
Recommended Solutions:

Ask students to propose solutions or code modifications for the identified vulnerabilities.
Emphasize the importance of providing clear and effective solutions to mitigate the identified issues.
Grading Criteria:

Use of Slither: Evaluate the student's ability to effectively use the Slither tool to perform static analysis.
Identification of Vulnerabilities: Assess the accuracy and completeness of vulnerability identification.
Quality of Report: Review the quality and clarity of the submitted report, including detailed descriptions and proposed solutions.
