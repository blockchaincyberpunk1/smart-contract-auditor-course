Smart Contract Simulator

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to give students hands-on experience in simulating the execution of a basic smart contract. This activity helps students understand how smart contracts work and allows them to visualize the impact of different inputs and parameters.

Instructions:

Smart Contract Selection:

Provide students with a simple smart contract written in a blockchain programming language like Solidity. The contract should have clearly defined functions and parameters.
Simulator Development:

Instruct students to create a Python program that serves as a smart contract simulator.
The simulator should allow users to:
Input values and parameters required by the smart contract functions.
Execute the smart contract functions.
View the resulting state changes, transactions, or outputs.
Students should implement logic that mimics the execution of the smart contract's functions and updates the contract's state accordingly.
Documentation:

Require students to document their Python code thoroughly. This documentation should include comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each part of the simulator.
Simulation and Analysis:

Ask students to use their simulator to execute the smart contract with different inputs and parameters.
Instruct students to analyze and document the outcomes of these simulations, highlighting how the contract's state changes with varying inputs.
Submission:

Request students to submit both their Python code and a report summarizing their simulation results and observations.
Grading Criteria:

Implementation: Assess the correctness and functionality of the simulator.
Documentation: Evaluate the quality and clarity of code comments and explanations.
Analysis: Review the depth of analysis in the simulation results and observations.
Presentation: Consider the organization and presentation of the report.
