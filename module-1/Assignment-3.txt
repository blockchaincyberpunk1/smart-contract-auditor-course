Blockchain Application Idea

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to stimulate students' creativity and critical thinking by challenging them to conceptualize a blockchain-based application. Through this task, students will learn to identify real-world problems that can be addressed using blockchain technology and develop innovative solutions.

Instructions:

Problem Identification:

Task students with researching and identifying a real-world problem or challenge that can be effectively solved or improved using blockchain technology.
Encourage them to focus on a problem area of their interest, such as finance, supply chain, healthcare, or social impact.
Application Concept:

Instruct students to develop a blockchain-based application concept that addresses the identified problem.
Require students to provide a detailed description of their application idea, including:
The purpose and objectives of the application.
The target users or beneficiaries of the application.
The potential benefits and impact it can have on the problem area.
Features and Functionality:

Ask students to outline the key features, functionality, and components of their proposed application.
Encourage them to think about how blockchain's unique properties (e.g., decentralization, transparency, immutability) can be leveraged to solve the problem effectively.
Technical Considerations:

Require students to consider technical aspects such as the choice of blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum, Quorum), smart contract functionality, and data management.
Students should briefly explain how these technical elements contribute to the application's functionality.
Presentation or Report:

Request students to present their blockchain application idea either through a written report or an in-class presentation.
During the presentation, students should effectively communicate their concept, problem statement, potential users, and features.
Grading Criteria:

Problem Identification: Assess the relevance and significance of the identified problem.
Application Concept: Evaluate the clarity and completeness of the proposed application idea.
Features and Functionality: Review the feasibility and innovation of the application's features.
Technical Considerations: Consider the technical soundness and appropriateness of blockchain elements.
Presentation or Report: Evaluate the effectiveness of the presentation or written report.
