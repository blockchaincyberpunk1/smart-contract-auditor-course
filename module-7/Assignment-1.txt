Audit Finding Documentation

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to document audit findings effectively. Students will be provided with a simplified Ethereum smart contract containing known vulnerabilities. They will conduct a security audit of the contract and practice documenting their findings. This assignment aims to enhance students' skills in identifying and reporting vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

Instructions:

Introduction to Audit Finding Documentation:

Begin by explaining the assignment's objective, which is to teach students how to effectively document audit findings during a security assessment.
Emphasize the importance of clear and comprehensive documentation in the smart contract auditing process.
Simplified Ethereum Smart Contract:

Provide students with a simplified Ethereum smart contract that intentionally contains known vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities may include issues such as reentrancy, integer overflow, or access control flaws.
Ensure that the contract's vulnerabilities are representative of common security issues found in real-world contracts.
Security Audit:

Instruct students to conduct a thorough security audit of the provided smart contract.
Task them with analyzing the contract's code to identify and document all vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and issues they discover.
Audit Findings Documentation:

Require students to create a comprehensive audit report that includes the following components:
Vulnerability Descriptions: Document each identified vulnerability with a clear and concise description. Include information about the affected code, the nature of the vulnerability, and its potential impact.
Risk Assessments: Assess the severity and potential consequences of each vulnerability. Use a risk rating or scoring system to categorize vulnerabilities based on their impact and exploitability.
Suggested Remediations: Provide detailed recommendations for fixing or mitigating each identified vulnerability. Explain how the issues can be addressed to enhance the contract's security.
Report Format:

Specify the format for the audit report, such as using a template or document structure that includes sections for vulnerability descriptions, risk assessments, and suggested remediations.
Clarity and Detail:

Emphasize the importance of clear and detailed documentation to ensure that developers and stakeholders can understand the findings and take appropriate actions.
Submission and Evaluation:

Collect and evaluate students' audit reports, considering the clarity of vulnerability descriptions, the accuracy of risk assessments, and the quality of suggested remediations.
Grading Criteria:

Clarity of Vulnerability Descriptions: Evaluate the clarity and completeness of students' descriptions of identified vulnerabilities.
Accuracy of Risk Assessments: Assess the accuracy of students' risk assessments, including their evaluation of the potential impact and exploitability of vulnerabilities.
Quality of Suggested Remediations: Evaluate the quality and feasibility of students' recommendations for fixing or mitigating vulnerabilities.
Overall Documentation: Consider the overall quality and completeness of the audit report, including its organization and formatting.
