Ethical Disclosure Process

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to responsible disclosure and ethical considerations in security reporting. In this assignment, students will explore the hypothetical scenario of discovering a critical vulnerability in a widely used smart contract and learn how to responsibly report the vulnerability to the contract's developers.

Instructions:

Introduction to Responsible Disclosure:

Begin by explaining the concept of responsible disclosure in the context of cybersecurity and smart contract auditing.
Emphasize the ethical responsibility of security researchers to report vulnerabilities in a way that protects users and allows developers to address issues before they can be exploited maliciously.
Hypothetical Scenario:

Describe a hypothetical scenario to set the context for the assignment. For example, you can mention that a student has discovered a critical vulnerability in a widely used Ethereum smart contract.
Research Responsible Disclosure Practices:

Instruct students to research and familiarize themselves with responsible disclosure practices and guidelines used in the cybersecurity industry. They should explore established frameworks and principles for reporting vulnerabilities.
Create a Step-by-Step Guide:

Task students with creating a step-by-step guide on how to ethically report the discovered vulnerability to the contract's developers.
Each step should include clear instructions and considerations for responsible disclosure. Students should address the following points:
How to identify the correct contact information for the contract's developers or maintainers.
How to communicate the vulnerability in a clear and concise manner, including providing technical details without exposing the vulnerability to malicious actors.
How to establish a secure and confidential channel of communication with the developers, such as using encrypted email or secure messaging platforms.
How to set a reasonable disclosure timeline that allows developers sufficient time to address the issue.
How to coordinate the public disclosure (if necessary) after the issue has been resolved.
Ethical Considerations:

Emphasize the importance of ethical considerations throughout the disclosure process. Students should be aware of the potential impact of their findings and the need to protect users' interests.
Submission and Evaluation:

Collect and evaluate students' step-by-step guides on ethical disclosure processes based on their completeness, clarity, and adherence to responsible disclosure principles.
Grading Criteria:

Completeness of the Guide: Evaluate whether the guide includes all necessary steps and considerations for responsible disclosure.
Clarity and Detail: Assess the clarity of instructions and the level of detail provided in each step.
Ethical Considerations: Consider whether the guide emphasizes ethical considerations and user protection throughout the process.
Feasibility: Evaluate the feasibility and practicality of the steps outlined in the guide for real-world security reporting scenarios.
