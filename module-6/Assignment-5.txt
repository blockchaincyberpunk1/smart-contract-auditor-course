Advanced Auditing Challenge

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students with a complex Ethereum smart contract and a series of advanced auditing tasks. Students will be provided with a multifaceted Ethereum smart contract containing various vulnerabilities. They are required to use a combination of formal verification, taint analysis, symbolic execution, and property-based testing to audit the contract thoroughly. The goal is to enhance students' proficiency in identifying and addressing complex smart contract vulnerabilities through advanced auditing techniques.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Advanced Auditing Challenge:

Begin by explaining the assignment's objective, which is to challenge students with a complex Ethereum smart contract and advanced auditing tasks.
Emphasize the significance of applying multiple auditing techniques to thoroughly assess the contract's security.
Complex Ethereum Smart Contract:

Provide students with a complex Ethereum smart contract that contains various vulnerabilities, including but not limited to reentrancy, integer overflow, access control, and logical flaws.
Ensure that the contract represents a real-world scenario with multifaceted functionality.
Advanced Auditing Techniques:

Instruct students to use a combination of advanced auditing techniques, including:
Formal verification: Using formal methods to mathematically prove the correctness of the contract.
Taint analysis: Identifying the flow of tainted data and potential vulnerabilities.
Symbolic execution: Analyzing the contract's behavior symbolically to uncover vulnerabilities.
Property-based testing: Creating property-based test cases to validate the contract's functionality and security.
Audit Process:

Guide students through the audit process, explaining how each auditing technique should be applied to the complex contract.
Encourage them to be thorough in their assessments and to consider all potential vulnerabilities.
Audit Report Preparation:

Require students to prepare a comprehensive audit report that includes the following components:
Findings: Document all vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and issues identified during the audit.
Remediation Strategies: Propose detailed solutions and fixes for each identified vulnerability.
Testing Results: Include the outcomes of the various auditing techniques, such as formal verification proofs, taint analysis reports, symbolic execution findings, and property-based testing results.
Recommendations: Offer recommendations for improving the contract's security and robustness.
Complexity and Depth:

Emphasize that this assignment is designed to challenge students with a complex and multifaceted contract. Encourage them to delve deep into the auditing process.
Submission and Evaluation:

Collect and evaluate students' comprehensive audit reports, considering the thoroughness of their assessments, the effectiveness of the applied techniques, and the quality of their recommendations.
Grading Criteria:

Effectiveness of Auditing Techniques: Assess the effectiveness of students' use of advanced auditing techniques in identifying vulnerabilities.
Quality of Audit Report: Evaluate the completeness and quality of students' audit reports, including findings, remediation strategies, and testing results.
Depth of Analysis: Consider the depth of students' analysis of the complex contract and the vulnerabilities identified.
Recommendations: Assess the quality of students' recommendations for improving the contract's security.
