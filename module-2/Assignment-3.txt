Token Creation in Solidity

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to reinforce students' understanding of Solidity and smart contract development by having them create a custom ERC-20 token. Students will write a Solidity smart contract to define and deploy their custom token on the Ethereum blockchain's testnet.

Instructions:

Introduction to Token Creation:

Provide students with an introduction to ERC-20 tokens and their importance in the Ethereum ecosystem.
Explain the key properties of ERC-20 tokens, such as name, symbol, total supply, and functions for transferring tokens.
Smart Contract Task:

Instruct students to write a Solidity smart contract that defines a custom ERC-20 token.
Specify the following details for the custom token:
Name
Symbol
Total supply (an initial supply of tokens)
Decimals (typically 18 for most tokens)
Any additional features, such as minting or burning functions.
Token Deployment:

Guide students on how to compile and deploy their custom token smart contract to the Ethereum testnet.
Ensure they obtain the contract address and transaction details for verification.
Testing and Interactions:

Instruct students to interact with their deployed token smart contract on the Ethereum testnet.
Ask them to perform actions such as transferring tokens, checking balances, and utilizing any additional functions they implemented.
Submission:

Request students to submit a report that includes:
The Solidity code of their custom ERC-20 token smart contract.
Screenshots or logs of the deployment process and transaction confirmations.
Descriptions of interactions with the deployed token smart contract.
Any challenges encountered during development and testing.
Grading Criteria:

Smart Contract Development: Evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the ERC-20 token smart contract code.
Deployment: Assess the correctness of the deployment process and confirmation of successful deployment.
Interaction: Evaluate the completeness of students' interactions with the deployed token smart contract.
Documentation: Review the quality and completeness of the submitted report.
