Ethereum Smart Contract Deployment

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to Ethereum as a smart contract development platform and guide them through the process of deploying their first smart contract. This assignment provides hands-on experience in setting up a development environment, compiling a smart contract, and deploying it on the Ethereum blockchain.

Instructions:

Smart Contract Template:

Provide students with a basic smart contract template written in Solidity. The template could be a simple token contract or a basic decentralized application (DApp).
Setting Up the Development Environment:

Instruct students to set up an Ethereum development environment. They can use online tools like Remix or local development environments like Truffle and Ganache.
Ensure that students have access to an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Ropsten) or a local blockchain for testing purposes.
Smart Contract Deployment:

Guide students through the following steps:
Compiling the smart contract code using the chosen development environment.
Deploying the compiled smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain, either on a testnet or a local blockchain.
Confirming the successful deployment by obtaining the contract address and transaction details.
Interacting with the Smart Contract:

Instruct students to interact with the deployed smart contract. They should perform actions such as sending transactions, executing functions, and reading data from the contract.
Submission:

Request students to submit a report that includes:
Details of the smart contract they deployed, including its purpose.
Screenshots or logs of the deployment process.
Descriptions of interactions with the deployed smart contract.
Any challenges faced during deployment and interaction.
Grading Criteria:

Environment Setup: Check if students successfully set up their development environment.
Smart Contract Deployment: Evaluate the accuracy of the deployment process and confirmation of successful deployment.
Interaction: Assess the completeness of students' interactions with the deployed smart contract.
Documentation: Review the quality and completeness of the submitted report.
