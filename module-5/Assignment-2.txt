Vulnerability Exploitation

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to gain practical experience by simulating the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a vulnerable smart contract. By doing so, students will deepen their understanding of smart contract vulnerabilities and learn how to exploit them in a controlled environment. Additionally, they will explore potential mitigation strategies to address these vulnerabilities.

Instructions:

Introduction to Vulnerability Exploitation:

Provide an overview of the assignment's objective, which is to simulate the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
Emphasize the importance of understanding vulnerabilities from both an auditing and an attacker's perspective.
Selection of a Vulnerable Smart Contract:

Offer a vulnerable Ethereum smart contract with known issues, such as reentrancy or unchecked sends.
Ensure that the vulnerabilities in the contract are well-documented.
Exploitation Process:

Instruct students to choose the provided vulnerable smart contract for exploitation.
Guide them through the process of exploiting the identified vulnerabilities, which includes:
Crafting malicious transactions or interactions to exploit the vulnerabilities.
Demonstrating how each vulnerability can be abused to achieve unauthorized actions or gains.
Recording their actions and observations during the exploitation process.
Mitigation Strategies:

Task students with proposing mitigation strategies to address the vulnerabilities exploited.
Encourage them to explore potential fixes or code modifications that would prevent the vulnerabilities from being exploited.
Require students to provide detailed explanations for each proposed mitigation.
Exploitation Report:

Ask students to compile their findings and exploitation process into a comprehensive report.
In the report, students should include:
A description of the vulnerabilities in the selected contract.
A step-by-step account of the exploitation process, including transaction details.
Demonstrations of the consequences of exploiting each vulnerability.
Proposed mitigation strategies and explanations for each.
Considerations for developers and auditors to prevent such vulnerabilities.
Submission and Discussion:

Require students to submit their exploitation reports along with any code snippets or modifications used.
Optionally, organize a discussion or presentation session where students can share their experiences and insights from the exploitation exercise.
Grading Criteria:

Successful Exploitation: Evaluate the students' ability to exploit the vulnerabilities in the provided contract effectively.
Quality of Mitigation Strategies: Assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed fixes or mitigations.
Clarity of Reporting: Consider the clarity and organization of the exploitation report, including the step-by-step account of the exploitation process.
